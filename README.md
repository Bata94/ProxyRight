# ProxyRight

A simple ReverseProxy and LoadBalancer, mainly for Docker.

[Traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/) is a great product so use it instead :)

My main problem with it is the configuration and performance.
That's why I want to explore what's possible with this project. A rewrite in a lower language (c, rust or zig) might be necessary to solve the performance side. But first I want to create a good configuration structure and a version 1.
To learn the ins and outs of http(/s) and maybe TCP and even UDP.

So do not use ProxyRight in production! If you are testing it, leave your feedback as an Issue. PRs are welcome of course!
